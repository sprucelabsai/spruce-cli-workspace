// Can you believe how far we've come?

// For these tests, we're going to get to creating, reading, updating, and deleting todos.

// Great news is that I'll do most of the work for you, I just need you define some things for me.

// When you're ready, hit control+space and type "create.store" into the command prompt.

// See you there!

// PS, you can delete the introduction test below.
